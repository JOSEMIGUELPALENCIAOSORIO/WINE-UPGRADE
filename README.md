## Project Overview:
A tool aimed at predicting wine quality by analyzing key attributes from two distinct datasets for white and red wines based in Portugal

## Data Utilized:
The project employs datasets that include features like various types of acidity, sugar, sulfur dioxide content, density, pH levels, sulphates, and alcohol content.

## Methodology:
Leveraging the RandomForestClassifier after using logist, the project undertakes hyperparameter optimization through grid search to determine the most effective model parameters.

## Outcomes:
Evaluation of the model's performance is detailed in the Python notebook, with predictions available for consultation in a 'predictions.csv' file.
